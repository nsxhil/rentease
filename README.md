# Welcome to RentEase
  This is a project I worked on with 2 other people for Database Systems lab in 4th sem. It is a rental listing platform using MySQL and Flask as the backend and HTML/CSS for the front end
  `db.py` includes all the connectivity, routing and queries. Run the python file and open localhost@port to open the website. Make sure your MySQL database is set up using the `dbDetails.txt`, which includes all the SQL I used.
  The project involved designing a database schema and normaizing it to it's highest form. All details are in the report.
